As the project evolves over time, the main objective is create a hybrid version of existing monitoring, evaluation and performance systems, in order to boost accuracy,
help in automation, real-time learning, and to gether usefull user feedback

It my final year project, and as time moves one, i'll build on top of the working prototype that i'll have to submit. The threshold of its complexity cannot be met while
i'm still in school, but it will be done afterwards. Do enjoy, raise your concerns and feel free to contribute.
