## Prerequisite libraries
Here are the Python libraries used in the creation of this dashboard app

## Data source
US Population data spanning the duration of 2010-2019 was obtained from the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-state-total.html).

## Reference
A talk entitled [_Crafting a Dashboard App in Python using Streamlit_](https://budapestbi.hu/2023/hu/program/speakers/chanin-nantasenamat/) showing how to build this app is given at the [Budapest BI Forum (Data Visualization track)](https://budapestbi.hu/2023/hu/en/program-data-visualization-track/) on November 22, 2023.
=======
As the project evolves over time, the main objective is create a hybrid version of existing monitoring, evaluation and performance systems, in order to boost accuracy,
help in automation, real-time learning, and to gether usefull user feedback

It my final year project, and as time moves one, i'll build on top of the working prototype that i'll have to submit. The threshold of its complexity cannot be met while
i'm still in school, but it will be done afterwards. Do enjoy, raise your concerns and feel free to contribute.
